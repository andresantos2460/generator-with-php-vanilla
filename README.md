# **password Genius**

This was a mini project that I developed to learn a little more vanilla php, I started directly in laravel and I feel like I was missing some bases.
Even though I haven't mastered the language yet, I feel that this project has helped me enough, also due to the fact that I haven't used practically any AI.
